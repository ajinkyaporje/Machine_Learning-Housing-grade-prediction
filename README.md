# Machine_Learning-Housing-grade-prediction

Machine learning is widely used to build predictive models for data analysis.
The dataset consists of a training file that we use to train the algorithm to make predictions over the test file.
The file contains about 2500+ missing values. We use KNN Imputation to autofill the missing places for better prediction.
The model used to train the machine is Support Vector Machine(SVM) through which we achieve up to 91.87% accuracy.

Tools used: -
R language.
KNN Imputation to replace the missing values.
SVM for building machine learning algorithm.
